# Win11Clean
An installation guide for Microsoft Windows 11 Professional to remove telemetry, adware and other annoyances.

This is currently a text-based, point-and-click guide.  The intention is for the user to understand what they're doing, what they're affecting, and how the modification is performed so the user can understand how to reverse the change.

It is possible that this guide may be updated over time to offer a configurable script-driven solution.  I will make no such promises at this time.

This guide was last updated on _**2023-07-16**_, for Windows 11 22H2.

The guide currently contains the following sections:

1. Initial Setup (from ISO or Flash Drive)
2. Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) Setup
3. Post-Install Configuration - **This is the bulk of the guide!**

If you already have an existing Windows 11 installation, go straight to **3. Post-Install Configuration**.  Some privacy and telemetry settings are not covered in this section, as it is assumed that these would've already been handled by the first two sections.  The guide may be updated at some point in time to provide guidance for users to change those settings on an existing Windows 11 installation.  For the time being, that will be an exercise left to the reader.
